## Preparing for Influenza Season in the U.S.
Every year, the U.S. experience a season when more people than usual get the flu, especially among the vulnerable population. This causes a surge in patients at hospitals and clinics across the 50 states. 
I worked with a medical staffing agency, that provides temporary healthcare professionals to the hospitals and clinics, to examine influenza trends and maximize their staffing plan.
The flu season staffing project was critical to ensuring that hospitals and clinics were able to provide timely and effective care (nurses, physician assistants, and doctors) to patients during a time of increased demand.
